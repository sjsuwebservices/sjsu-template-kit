Template Kit for SJSU web templates

Overview

Increasing the base font size from 11px to 16px required expanding some page elements to the full width of the page by making a few structural changes.

Additionally, the html structure around the multi-column layout was particularly unintuitive and required far more CSS specificity than necessary in order to properly style web content. It was simplified.

Images depicting abstractions of the structural changes are available in the readme.html file in the /readme/ folder.
